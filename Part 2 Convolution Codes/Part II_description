The gauss-seidel iterative method is much quicker than the jacobi method because of the replacing of the input values. Regardless of decoding a y stream or performing iterative methods on standard matrices this is the case, The n is very important because the n and n alone dictates the A0 and A1 matrices. This is because A0 and A1 only change in size. It also directly correlates to the number of iterations. The larger the n, the more number of iterations it will take to reach desired precision.
