PART II
1. Encoding
The encoding function takes a single n (cannot be less than 4) value and produces a x, A0, A1, y0, y1, and yStream

2. Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel (Standard)
These two functions take in a dat file that contains an nxn matrix A and an nx1 vector b, a tolerance threshhold, and when run, will ask for the user input to get an initial guess vector. This will report the number of iterations and the final answer, or that the method did not converge.

3. Decoding
There are two functions that both take a single yStream (whose length cannot be less than 4). One uses the Jacobi iteraitve method, and one uses Gauss-Seidel.Running the program will prompt the user to enter the y0 and y1 of the y stream and an intial guess vector. Then the code will create an A0 and A1 based on n and iterate it to return an xStream. It will print the inputs, the x stream, and the number iterations it took with the jacobi method and the gauss_seidel method.
